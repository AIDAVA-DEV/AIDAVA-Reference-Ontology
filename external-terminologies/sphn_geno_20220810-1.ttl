At present many parts of the model are exploratory and set to undergo refactoring.  In addition, many classes and properties have GENO URIs but are place holders for classes that will be imported from an external ontology (e.g. SO, ChEBI, OBI, etc).  Furthermore, ongoing work will implement a model of genotype-to-phenotype associations. This will support description of asserted and inferred relationships between a genotypes, phenotypes, and environments, and the evidence/provenance behind these associations. Documentation is under development as well, and for now a slidedeck is available at http://www.slideshare.net/mhb120/brush-icbo-2013." .

Barry Smith

The official OBI definition, explaining the meaning of a class or property: 'Shall be Aristotelian, formalized and normalized. Can be augmented with colloquial definitions'  is terrible.

Can you fix to something like:

A statement of necessary and sufficient conditions explaining the meaning of an expression referring to a class or property.

Alan Ruttenberg

Your proposed definition is a reasonable candidate, except that it is very common that necessary and sufficient conditions are not given. Mostly they are necessary, occasionally they are necessary and sufficient or just sufficient. Often they use terms that are not themselves defined and so they effectively can't be evaluated by those criteria. 

On the specifics of the proposed definition:

We don't have definitions of 'meaning' or 'expression' or 'property'. For 'reference' in the intended sense I think we use the term 'denotation'. For 'expression', I think we you mean symbol, or identifier. For 'meaning' it differs for class and property. For class we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine whether an entity is instance of the class, or not. For property we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine, given a pair of potential relata, whether the assertion that the relation holds is true. The 'intended reader' part suggests that we also specify who, we expect, would be able to understand the definition, and also generalizes over human and computer reader to include textual and logical definition. 

Personally, I am more comfortable weakening definition to documentation, with instructions as to what is desirable. 

We also have the outstanding issue of how to aim different definitions to different audiences. A clinical audience reading chebi wants a different sort of definition documentation/definition from a chemistry trained audience, and similarly there is a need for a definition that is adequate for an ontologist to work with.

	obo:IAO_0000118 "is_sequence_variant_of" ;
	rdfs:comment """To allow users to make important distinctions in discourse and modeling, GENO clearly separates the notions/levels of 'biological sequence', 'sequence feature', and 'sequence location' ('genomic locus' when found in a genome). This sets up an important terminological nuance when it comes to alleles, where we believe it correct to say that a particular genomic feature is an alleles_of some genomic locus (as opposed to an allele_of some sequence or some feature). This is typically a gene locus, but even insertions falling outside of genes are considered alleles_of the locus they alter (e.g. alleles of other types of named loci such as QTLs, or alleles of some unnamed locus of arbitrary size).

While conceptually it is most correct to say features are alleles_of some genomic locus, it is common practice to say that they are alleles of the class of feature defined to reside at that locus (typically a gene).  Accordingly, we may write things like \"fgf8a<ti282a> is an allele of the Danio rerio fgf8a gene\", and we may create data where fgf8a<ti282a> is asserted as an allele_of  the fgf8a gene class IRI. But here we mean more precisely that it is an allele of the locus at which the fgf8a gene resides.  Allowing for this means that we dont have to create 'feature-based location/locus' terms mirroing all feature class terms already in exiistence (e.g. for every gene).

It is important to be clear that the location/locus that a feature is an allele_of is defined exclusively by its genomic position, and not on the sequence it may contains. This is particularly relevant when considering transgenic insertions. For example, this means that the insertion of the S. cerevisiae GAL4 gene sequence within the D. melanogaster Bx gene locus would create an allele of the D. melanogaster Bx gene, but not an allele of the S. cerevisiae GAL4 gene. The transgene that results from such an insertion, while expressing S. cerevisiae GAL4 gene sequence, is not an allele of this gene because it does not reside at the S. cerevisiae GAL4 locus. 

This departs from how some databases use the term 'allele' - where transgenes expressing an exogenous gene are considered to be alleles of the exogenous genes they carry.  For example, in the example above, Flybase describes the S. cerevisiae GAL4 transgene as an allele_of the  S. cerevisiae GAL4 gene (and gives it the allele identifier FBal0040476). A GENO representation on the other hand would say that the S. cerevisiae GAL4 transgene derives_sequence_from the S. cerevisiae GAL4 gene, but is not an allele_of this gene. In a GENO model, FBal0040476 would be typed as a transgene insertion, but not considered an allele_of the Scer\\GAL4 gene.

At the end of the day, it's just semantics, but worth clarifying given the ubiquity and variable use of the term 'allele'. The GENO model attempts to define and adhere to the principled notion of positionally-defined 'alleles', and functionally-defined 'transgenes'.""" ;

Where this is the case, it is noted in the annotations on the property chains.

Below are the different kinds/paths of propagation we desire:
1. Propagation 'down' a genotype (from larger components to smaller ones)
2. Propagation 'up' a genotype (from smaller components to larger ones)
3. From sex-qualified genotypes down to the sex-agnostic genotype and its components (but not 'up' to a sex-qualified genotype).
4. From an effective genotype to its intrinsic and extrinsic components.
5. From genotype components to genes (note here that a separate chain is needed to propagate conditions asserted on a sequence alteration to the gene, because of the fact that the link to the gene is from the variant locus/allele).
6. (Exploratory). There are cases where we may also want inter-genotype propagation (i.e. propagation that extends beyond moving up or down a single genotype). For example, if a phenotype is asserted on a sex-qualified intrinsic genotype, we want it to infer down through its component sex-agnostic intrinsic genotype and then up to any effective genotypes of which this sex-agnostic intrinsic genotype is a part. Given the data in hand, however, the conditions for this will likely never occur, so probably ok not to implement a chain to support this.

Note that we do not want to propagate phenotypes up from sex-agnostic genotyeps to sex-qualified ones (e.g.from shha<tbx392>/shha<tbx392> [AB] to shha<tbx392>/shha<tbx392> [AB](male)) - because it may not be the case that a phenotype assessed without consideratioon to sex will apply on a sex-specific background.  So we would not create a property chain to propagate inferred condition associations from sex-agnaostic intrinsic genotypes and their parts to sex-qualified intrinsic genotypes and effective genotypes that contain them (such as:  has_variant_part o has_sex_agnostic_part o has_variant_part o 'causes condition')""" ;

This property chain propagates a phenotype asserted on a sex-qualified intrinsic genotype, down to its sex-agnostic genotype part, and then up to a parent effective genotype that has it as a variant part. I think this is OK in all cases, so we can implement this as the one case where we can have inter-genotype pheno propagation.  But as noted, there will likely be no data that actually meets criteria to use this chain, so we can probably leave it out.""" .

Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay.

Many will be 'wild-type' or at least functional gene alleles. But some may be alleles that are mutated or truncated so as to lack functionality.  According to current SO criteria defining genes, a 'gene' no longer exists in the case of a non-functional or deleted variant. But the 'gene allele' does exist -  and its extent is that of the remaining/altered sequence based on alignment with a  reference gene.  Even for completely deleted genes, an allele of the gene exists (and here is equivalent to the junction corresponding to the where gene would live based on a reference alignment).

This design allows us to classify genes and any variants of those genes (be they functional or not) as the same type of thing (ie a 'gene allele'), since classification is based on genomic position rather than functional capacity. This is practical for representation of variant genotypes which often carry non-functional versions  of a gene at a particular locus.

By contrast, the concept of a 'gene allele' here is positionally defined - representing the sequence present at the location a gene resides in a reference genome (based on sequence alignment).  An Shh gene allele, for example, may be a fully functional wild-type version of the gene, a non-functional version carrying a deleterious point mutation, a truncated version of the gene, or even a complete deletion. In all these cases, an 'Shh gene allele' exists at the position where the canonical gene resides in the reference genome - even if the extent of this allele different than the wild-type, or even zero in the case of the complete deletion.

A genomic feature being an allele_of a gene is based on its location in a host genome - not on its sequence. This means, for example, that the insertion of the human SMN2 gene into the genome of a mouse (see http://www.informatics.jax.org/allele/MGI:3056903) DOES NOT represent an allele_of the human SMN2 gene according to the GENO model - because it is located in a mouse genome, not a human one.  Rather, this is a transgenic insertion that derives_sequence_from the human SMN2 gene.  If this human SMN2 gene is inserted within the mouse SMN2 gene locus (e.g. used to replace mouse SMN2 gene), the feature it creates is an allele_of the mouse SMN2 gene (one that happens to match the sequence of the human ortholog of the gene).

Zygosities such as heterozygous and homozygous are simple, common examples of 'states' of an allele. 

These genetic and environmental \"interactions\" of alleles play out at the level of the gene products produced by the causal alleles, and are observable in the pattern with which the trait caused by an allele is inherited across generations of individuals. Thus, an inheritance pattern such as dominance is not inherent to a single allele or its phenotype, but rather a result of the relationship between two alleles of a gene and the phenotype that results in a given environment.

2. The location of a genomic feature is defined by start and end coordinates based on alignment with a reference genome. Genomic features can span any size from a complete chromosome, to a chromosomal band or region, to a gene, to a single base pair or even junction between base pairs (this would be a sequence feature with an extent of zero). 

3. As sequence features, instances of genomic features are identified by both their inherent *sequence* and their *position* in a genome - as determined by an alignment with some reference sequence. Accordingly, the 'ATG' start codon in the coding DNA sequence of the human AKT gene and the 'ATG' start codon in the human SHH gene represent two distinct genomic features despite having he same sequence, in virtue of their different positions in the genome.""" ;

But we also found 'allele' used to refer to other types and extents of variation - including single nucleotide polymorphisms, repeat regions, and copy number variations [7][8][9][10][11], where such variations don't neccessarily impact a gene.

To be maximally accommodating of how this term is used across research communities, GENO defines 'allele' broadly and allow alleles can span any locus or extent of sequence. While 'alleles' encountered in public datases typically overlap a gene, many do not. But GENO does define the 'gene allele' class as a subtype of 'allele' to refers more specifically to a specifc version of an entire gene.

The fact that we are counting how many copies of the same *sequence* exist in a genome, as opposed to how many of the same *feature*, is what sets  feature-level concepts like 'single locus complement'. apart from sequence-level concepts like 'copy number complement'. To illustrate the difference, consider a duplication event that creates a new copy of the human APOE gene on a different chromosome. This creates an entirely new sequence feature at a distinct locus from that of the original APOE gene.  The 'copy number complement' for sequence defined by the APOE gene locus would have a count of three, as this sequence is present three times in the genome.

Note however that the VMC genotype concept likely is not intended to cover 'effective' and 'extrinsic' genotype concepts defined in GENO.""" ;
	rdfs:comment """1. Scope of 'Genetic State': 
'Genetic state' is considered quite broadly in GENO to describe two general kinds of 'states'.  First, is traditional notion of 'allelic state' - defined as the complement of alleles present at a particular location or locations in a genome (i.e. across all homologous chromosomes containing this location). Here, a genotype can describe allelic state at a specific locus in a genome (an 'allelic genotype'), or describe the allelic state across the entire genome ('genomic genotype'). Second, this concept can also describe states of genomic features 'extrinsic' to their intrinsic sequence, such as the expression status of a gene as a result of being specifically targeted by experimental interventions such as RNAi, morpholinos, or CRISPRs.

2. Genotype Subtypes:
In GENO, we use the term 'intrinsic' for genotypes describing variation in genomic sequence, and 'extrinsic' for genotypes describing variation in gene expression (e.g. resulting from the targeted experimental knock-down or over-expression of endogenous genes).  We use the term 'effective genotype' to describe the total intrinsic and extrinsic variation in a cell or organism at the time a phenotypic assessment is performed. 

Two more precise conccepts are subsumed by the notion of an 'intrinsic genotype': (1) 'allelic genotypes', which specify allelic state at a single genomic location; and (2) 'genomic genotypes', which specify allelic state across an entire genome.  In both cases, allelic state is typically specified in terms of a differential between a reference and a set of 1 or more known variant features.

3. The Genotype Partonomy: 
'Genomic genotypes' describing sequence variation across an entire genome are 'decomposed' in GENO into a partonomy  of more granular levels of variation. These levels are defined to be meaningful to biologists in their attempts to relate genetic variation to phenotypic features. They include 'genomic variation complement' (GVC), 'variant single locus complement' (VSLC), 'allele', 'haplotype', 'sequence alteration', and 'genomic background' classes.  For example, the components of the zebrafish genotype \"fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a>; fgf3<t24149/+>[AB]\", described at  zfin.org/ZDB-FISH-150901-9362, include the following elements:

 - GVC: fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a>; fgf3<t24149/+> (total intrinsic variation in the genome)
 - Genomic Background: AB (the reference against which the GVC is variant)
 - VSLC1:  fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a> (homozygous complement of gene alleles at one known variant locus)
 - VSLC2:  fgf3<t24149/+> (heterozygous complement of gene alleles at another known variant locus)
 - Allele 1:  fgf8a<ti282a>   (variant version of the fgf8a gene, present in two copies)
 - Allele 2:  fgf3<t24149>    (variant version of the fgf3 gene, present in one copy)
 - Allele 3:   fgf3<+>    (wild-type version of the fgf3 gene, present in one copy)
 - Sequence Alteration1: <ti282a>  (the specific mutation within the fgf8a gene that makes it variant)
 - Sequence Alteration2: <t24149> (the specific mutation within the fgf3 gene that makes it variant)

A graphical representation of this decomposition that maps each element to a visual depiction of the portion of a genome it denotes can be found here: https://github.com/monarch-initiative/GENO-ontology/blob/develop/README.md

One reason that explicit representation of these levels is important is because it is at these levels that phenotypic features are annotated to genetic variations in different clinical and model organism databases For example, ZFIN typically annotates phenotypes to effective genotypes, MGI to intrinsic genotypes, Wormbase to variant alleles, and ClinVar to haplotypes and sequence alterations. The ability to decompose a genotype into representations at these levels allows us to \"propagate phenotypes\" up or down the partonomy (e.g. infer associations of phenotypes annotated to a genotype to its more granular levels of variation and the gene(s) affected). This helps to supporting integrated analysis of G2P data.""" ;

	terms:source "Informed by https://isogg.org/wiki/Haplotype and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype." ;
	rdfs:comment """A haplotype is a set of non-overlapping alleles that reside in close proximity on the same DNA strand. We model them as 'complements' because they include all known/relevant alleles within a defined region in the genome (e.g. a 'gene', or a 'haplotype block') - where this set may consist of 0, 1, or more alterations from some reference.  Because they are genetically linked, the alleles comprising a haplotype are likely to be co-inherited and survive descent across many generations of reproduction. 

As highlighted in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype, the term 'haplotype' is most commonly used to describe the following scenarios of genetic linkage between 'alleles':

1. The 'alleles' comprising the haplotype are 'single nucleotide polymorphisms' (SNPs) or other small alterations, which  collectively tend to occur together on a chromosomal strand). This use of 'haplotype' is commonly seen in phasing of patient WGS or WES data, to describe a state where two or more alterations that are believed to occur 'in cis' on the same chromosomal strand.  

2. The 'alleles' comprising the haplotype are SNPs or other short alterations, which collectively define a specific version of a gene. In this case, the locaiton bounding the haplotype corresponds to a gene locus, and the haplotype defines a specific allele of that gene (i.e 'gene allele'). \"Star alleles\" of PGx genes are examples of this category of haplotype (e.g. https://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ipd/imgt/hla/get_allele_hgvs.cgi?A*33:01:01, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4724253/).

3. Each of the 'alleles' comprising the haplotype is itself a 'gene allele' (i.e. a specific version of an entire gene), such that the haolotype contains multiple complete 'gene alleles' that are co-inherited because they reside in tightly linked clusters on a single chromosome.   

Each of these more specific definition serves a purpose for a particular type of genetic analysis or use case. The GENO definition of 'haplotype' is broadly inclusive of these and any other scenarios where distinct 'alleles' of any kind on the same chromosomal strand are genetically linked, and thus tend to be co-inherited across successive generations.""" ;

A haplotype (a contraction of the term ‘haploid genotype’) is a combination of alleles at multiple loci that are transmitted together on the same chromosome. Haplotype may refer to as few as two loci or to an entire chromosome depending on the number of recombination events that have occurred between a given set of loci. Genewise haplotypes are established with markers within a gene; familywise haplotypes are established with markers within members of a gene family; and regionwise haplotypes are established within different genes in a region at the same chromosome.

Current definition is based on http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/SO_0000355 ! haplotype_block (def = A region of the genome which is co-inherited as the result of the lack of historic recombination within it). If we stick with a region-level treatment, consdier if as a defined region of genomic sequence where variation is known to occur, a haplotype block should be classified as a subtype of allele.""" ;

A genomic genotype is an information artifact with a representational syntax that can specify what is known about the complete sequence of a genome.

Specifically, the genome sequence is determined by substituting all sequences specified by the 'genomic variation complement' for the corresponding sequences in the reference 'background genotype'.  So, while the total sequence content described in a genotype may exceed that of a single a genome (in that it includes a reference genome and variatoin complement), the intended resolution of these sequences is to arrive at a single genome sequence. It is this end-point that we consider when asserting that a genotype 'specifies' a genome.""" ;

We will work to resolve these questions and ideally converge these concepts in the future.

We don't link a Genomic Location to a specific reference sequence because in the FALDO model (which GENO adopts with the exception of swapping GENO:Genomic Locus for FALDO:Region), allows the start and end positions of a region to be defined on separate reference sequences. So while a given Location is conceptually associated with a single reference, in practice it can be pragmatic to define start and stop on different references sequences.""" , """In practice, GENO advocates describing biology at the level of genomic features - i.e. define specific terms for genes as genomic features, and not duplicate representation of the loci where each gene resides.

The utility of the 'genomic locus' class in the ontology is primarily to be clear about the distinction, but we would only use it in modeling data if absolutely needed.

For example, we would define an  'HLA gene block' as a subclass of 'genomic feature', and assert that  HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C genes are part/subsequences of this HLA gene block (as opposed to modeling this as an 'HLA locus'  and asserting that the HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C genes occupy this locus).""" ;

	rdfs:comment """1. A genomic location (aka locus) is defined by its begin and end coordinates on a reference genome, independent of a particular sequence that may reside there.  In GENO, we say that a genomic location is occupied_by a 'sequence feature' - where the identity of this feature depends on both it sequence, and its location in the genome (i.e. the locus it occupies).  For example, the 'ATG' sequence beginning the ORF of the human SHH gene shares the *same sequence* as the 'ATG' beginning the ORF of the human AKT gene. But these are *distinct sequence features* because they occupy different genomic locations. 
	
2. A given genomic location (e.g. the human SHH gene locus) may be occupied by different alleles (e.g. different alleles of the SHH gene). Within the genome of a single diploid organism, there is potential for two alleles to exist at such a locus (i.e. two different versions of the SHH gene).  And across genomes of all members of a species, many more alleles of the SHH gene may exist and occupy this same locus.

3. The notion of a genomic location in the realm of biological sequences is analogous to a BFO:spatiotemporal region in the realm of physical entities. A spatiotemporal region can be occupied_by physical objects, while a genomic location is occupied_by sequence features. Just as a spatiotemporal region is distinct from an object that occupies it, so too a genomic locus is distinct from a sequence feature that occupies it.  As a more concrete example, consider the distinction between a street address and the building that occupies it as analogous to the relationship between a genomic location and the feature that resides there.""" ;

In reality the sequence of each copy may not be identical, given the tendency of large regions to accumulate subtle variations. What matters is that they share a common origin/alignment with a defining location in a reference genome.

We represent the notion of copy number at the \"sequence level\" (as opposed to the \"sequence feature level\")  because we are concerned only with the number of copies of a sequence in a genome, and not the location of the features bearing this sequence. Consider a copy number complement comprised of three copies of the sequence defined by the location Chr8 100000-200000 on a GRCh38.2 reference genome.  In one person's genome, this sequence may appear at its normal location on Chromosome 8, as well as in duplications on chromosomes 5, and 12. In another genome the sequence might appear three times as well, but on chromosomes 8, 9, and 15.  When representing causal associations linking copy number to disease, it is important that these are considered to be *the same* copy number complement - because what a curator associates with a disease is the presence of three copies of some sequence in a genome, independent of their location. The \"sequence level\" representation here supports this use case.  By contrast, a \"feature level\" representation, where identity of a copy number complement would be based on the identity of member *features*), does not - because we have two sets comprised of entirely different features (based on location being tied to their identity).""" ;
	rdfs:comment """The count of how many of a particular sequences are found in a genome is the sequences 'copy number'. In diploid organisms, the normal copy number for sequences at most locations is 2 (a notable exception being those on the X-chromosome where normal copy number is 1). Variations in copy number occur if this count increases due to a duplication of the gene/region, or decreases due to a deletion of a gene/region. A driving use case for representing copy number is to support associations between variation in copy number of a particular sequence, and phenotypes or diseases that can result.

A 'complement' refers to an exhaustive collection of *all* objects that make up some well-defined set. Such a set may contain 0, 1, or more than one members. The notion of a complement is useful for defining many biologically-relevant sets of sequence features, such as 'copy number complements' representing the set of all copies of a particular sequence in a genome. 

The fact that we are counting how many copies of the same *sequence* exist in a genome here, as opposed to how many of the same *feature*, is what sets sequence-level concepts like 'copy number complement' apart from feature-level concepts like 'single locus complement'. To illustrate the difference, consider a duplication event that creates a new copy of the human APOE gene on a different chromosome. This creates an entirely new sequence feature at a distinct locus from that of the original APOE gene.  The 'copy number complement' for sequence defined by the APOE gene locus would have a count of three, as this sequence is present three times in the genome.  But the 'single locus complement' at the APOE gene locus would still have a count of two - because the duplicated copy is at a different location in the genome, and therefore does not represent a copy of the APOE locus.""" , "The notion of a 'complement' is useful as a special case of a set, where the members necessarily comprise an exhaustive collection of *all* objects that make up some well-defined set. Here, a 'copy number complement' represents 'represents the set of *all* copies of a specified sequence in a particular genome. Note that sequences can be duplicated in a set (i.e. contain more than one member representing the same sequence).

	obo:IAO_0000116 """Note that this 'variant copy number complement' class in GENO is related to but ontologically distinct from the SO 'copy number variation' class. The GENO class refers to a *set* of all copies of a sequence in a genome, where the number of members in the set departs from the genome's normal ploidy of sequences at that location. The SO class, which is defined as a \"sequence feature level\" concept (and therefore represents a single continuous extent of sequence), refers to a sequence alteration such as a deletion or duplication that changes the copy number of the affected sequence, and would result in the presence of  a 'variant copy number complement'.  The presence of an SO 'copy number variation' suggests, but does not guarantee, the existence of a GENO 'variant copy number complement' (e.g. if a second balancing event has occurred).

For example, the deletion variant reported in the ClinVar record here (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/21009/) is a copy number variation in the SO sense - a deletion that likely results in a GENO 'variant copy number complement'. Databases like ClinVar and dbVar type such alterations as 'copy number variants'.  But ClinVar also describes 'variant copy number complements' that may result from the presence of one or more SO 'copy number variations' in a given genome, e.g. here ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/221691/).  In this case, the submitter is asserting that a state in which only one copy of the defined sequence (Chr2: 73601366 - 73673202) exists in a genome is pathogenic for 'Premature ovarian failure'.  This requires more knowledge of the complete genomic state than an assertion that a specific SO 'copy number variation' (here, a deletion variant) is pathogenic for the condition - as here we know that not only is one copy deleted, but also that only one copy remains.""" ;

The notion of a complement is useful for defining many biologically-relevant sets of sequence features, such as the set of all functional copies of a particular sequence in a genome. This is known as the 'functional copy number' or 'genetic dosage' of the sequence.

'Functional copies' of a sequence are those that exhibit normal activity and/or produce gene products that exhibit normal activity associated with the sequence. The count of functional copies of a gene is often referred to as its 'dosage'. In diploid organisms, the normal 'dosage' is 2 for autosomal genes/regions. Dosage increases if there is a duplication of a functional gene/region. Dosage decreases if there is either a deletion of a gene/region, or an inactivating mutation that eliminates gene function. This sets it apart from the notion of a 'copy number complement', which reflects how many copies of a sequence exist in a genome, regardless of their functionality. Addition of a non-functional allele of a gene will increase its copy number, but not increase its dosage.

As we saw for 'copy number complement', the defining sequence here is specified in terms of a location on a reference sequence - typically the location where a gene or set of genes resides.  But the criteria for membership in a 'functional' copy number complement require only that the feature can perform the functions associated with the gene or genes at the defining location.  A gene allele that varies by only one nucleotide from the wild-type gene may not qualify as functional if that alteration eliminates the activity of the allele.""" ;

	rdfs:comment """On the relationship between 'transgenic insertions', 'transgenes', and 'alleles'
Transgenic insertions are sequence alterations comprised of foreign/exogenous sequence. This sequence can be from the same or different species  as the host cell or genome - it is exogenous in virtue of it being additional sequence inserted into the original host genome. A given transgenic insertion may create one or more transgenes when introduced into a host genome. The extent of a transgene is spans all features needed to drive its expression in the host genome.  In most cases a transgenic insertion completely contains one or more transgenes that are fully competent to drive expression in the host genome.  But in some cases, a transgenic insertion may carry only part of the final transgene it creates - which requires additional endogenous sequences in the vicinity of its insertion site to complete a functional gene (e.g. this is the case for enhancer traps or gene  traps) to complete.

In addition to the transgenes they create upon genomic integration, transgenic insertions can create variant alleles by disrupting a known endogenous gene/locus. Variant alleles are versions of a particular genomic features (typically genes), that are altered in their sequence relative to some reference.  An insertion that disrupts an endogenous gene would be considered a 'sequence alteration' (sensu SO) which creates a 'variant gene allele'. From the perspective of this disrupted gene, the origin or transgenic nature of this insertion is irrelevant - what matters here is that the gene's sequence has been altered to create an allele.  

For the purposes of modeling, any transgene(s) created when an endogenous gene is interrupted by an insertion is considered/modeled separately from the allele of the endogenous gene that is created by the insertion.  The transgenic insertion, which is simply a sequence alteration in the host genome, is then linked to any transgenes that it contributes to or overlaps with or contains.  The model of the Flybase example HERE illustrates this approach.""" , """Transgenes can exist as integrated into the host genome, or extra-chromosomally on replicons or transiently carried/expressed vectors.  What matters is that they are active in the context of a foreign biological system (typically a cell or organism).

Note that transgenes as defined here are not necessarily from a different taxon than that of the host genome.  For example, a Mus musculus gene over-expressed from a chromosomally-integrated expression construct in a Mus musculus genome qualifies as a transgene because it is exogenous to the host genome.""" ;

	rdfs:comment """1. A 'sequence alteration' is an allele whose sequence deviates in its entirety from that of other features found at the same genomic location (i.e. it deviates along its entire extent). In this sense, 'sequence alterations' represent the minimal extent an allele can take - i.e. that which is variable with some other feature along its entire sequence). An example is a SNP or insertion. 

Alleles whose extent goes beyond the specific sequence that is known to be variable are not sequence alterations. These are alleles that represent alternate versions of some larger, named feature. The classic example here is a 'gene allele', which spans the extent of an entire gene, and contains one or more sequence alterations (regions known to vary) as part.

2. Sequence alterations are not necessarily 'variant' in the sense defined in GENO (i.e. being 'variant with' some reference sequence).  In any comparison of alleles at a particular location, the choice of a 'reference' is context-dependent - as comparisons in other contexts might consider a different allele to be the reference. So while sequence alterations are usually considered 'variant' in the context in which they are considered, this variant status may not hold at all times. For this reason, the 'sequence alteration' class is not made an rdfs:subClassOf 'variant allele'. 

For a particular instance of a sequence alteration, howver, we may in some cases be able to rdf:type it as a 'varaint allele' and a 'sequence alteration', in situations where we can be confident that the feature will *never* be considered a reference. For example, experimentally generated mutations in model organism genes that are created expressly to vary from an established reference.

3. Note that we consider novel features gained in a genome to be sequence alterations, including aneusomic chromosomes gained through a non-disjunction event during replication, or extrachromosomal replicons that become part of the heritable genome of a cell or organism.""" ;
